=== OmegaSystems Map Data File Format (.omd) ===

This file format is designed to hold all the information
about a map used by the OmegaSystems 3D Engine. All information in a omd-File is part of an object.
Every object belongs to an object type and has an optional index.
If no index is given it is automacilly assumed to be zero.
